God (Divine)---Tears---Picker

About
====================
This script is for use with RSBot5 found on powerbot.org. It will automate the collection of God (Divine) tears from the battle for lumbridge world event.

Currently, the script only supports randomly collecting from each type of resource (Mining, chopping and fishing), but in the near feature, I plan on implementing a GUI (already did) to allow you to choose what you want the script to do.

This is my first script for RSBot 5 so please leave any feedback / suggestions on what I can improve on, or needs fixing.


Thanks :)!
